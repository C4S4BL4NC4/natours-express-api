#MongoDB is a document database with the scalability and flexibility that you want with querying and indexing that you need.


#### Key MongoDB features:

- **Document based**: MongoDB stores data in documents (filed-value pair data structures, NoSQL)
- **Scalable**: Very easy to distribute data across multiple machines as your users and amount of data grows.
- **Flexible**: No document data schema required, so each document can have different number and type of fields.
- **Performant**: Embedded data models, indexing, sharding, flexible documents, native duplication, etc.
- **Free and Open-Source**: published under SSPL License.

#MongoDB uses document structure that is very similar to `JSON` called `BSON`. 

==**BSON**: Data format MongoDB uses for data storage. Like JSON, **but typed**. So MongoDB documents are typed.== 


#### Notes about .BSON:

1.  Maximum size of `.bson` file is `16 MB`.
2.  For every new document there is `_id` that is generated by `ObjectID()` when a document is created.
