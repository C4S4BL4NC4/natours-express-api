[[MongoDB]]

It's a library that is used to connect a #MongoDB to our express application.

Mongoose is a layer of abstraction on top of the #MongoDB driver.



- **Mongoose schema:** where we model our data, describing the structure of the data, default values, and validation.
- **Mongoose model:** a wrapper for the schema, providing an interface to the database for CRUD operations.
